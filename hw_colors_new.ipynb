    "\n",
    "This homework and associated bake-off are oriented toward building an effective system for generating color descriptions that are pragmatic in the sense that they would help a reader/listener figure out which color was being referred to in a shared context consisting of a target color (whose identity is known only to the describer/speaker) and a set of distractors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook [colors_overview.ipynb](colors_overview.ipynb) should be studied before work on this homework begins. That notebook provides backgroud on the task, the dataset, and the modeling code that you will be using and adapting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The homework questions are more open-ended than previous ones have been. Rather than asking you to implement pre-defined functionality, they ask you to try to improve baseline components of the full system in ways that you find to be effective. As usual, this culminates in a prompt asking you to develop a novel system for entry into the bake-off. In this case, though, the work you do for the homework will likely be directly incorporated into that system (not required, but an efficient way to work at the very least)."
